# Playlist Planner 

## About

Playlist Planner is  an app that allows you to create playlists using Spotify's API. 
A custom link can be shared with friends or event attendees through which others can suggest songs for the playlist.
The playlist owner has the ability to approve (add the suggestion to the playlist) or decline the suggestions.

Playlist Planner gives you the ability to create collaborative playlists without giving up user control or information.
